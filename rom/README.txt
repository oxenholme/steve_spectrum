A replacement 48k Spectrum ROM for use with emulators.

The initial version was taken from Geoff Wearmouth's former website (http://www.wearmouth.demon.co.uk/zx82.htm). 

The ROM itself is copyright Amstrad plc but permission has been given to modify and re-distribute the ROM as long as the copyright message is retained and the resultant ROM is not used in real ZX Spectrum hardware.

The ROM contains the original copyright Sinclair Research Ltd message eventhough it appears Sinclair Research at no time owner the copyright over the code.
