Jet Set Willy by Software Projects

The original jsw.asm included here was generated by Richard Dymond (skoolkit.ca) from the original game images.

The changes here are my own.

The game has not been formally released to the public domain but Software Projects no longer exists and Matthew Smith, the author, has apparently given his blessing to re-distribution and modification.

My changes can be considered to be in the public domain.
